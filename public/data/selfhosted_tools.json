Deployable on Raspberry Pi, Docker, or Linux systems, it offers a web-based dashboard for device management, custom automations (rules based on time/sensor data), and secure remote access via tunnels. All data stays local by default, giving users full control over their IoT ecosystem, with extensions available to add new features or device compatibility.",
