    <h1>About ToolStock</h1>
    <p>
      <strong>ToolStock</strong> is a curated directory designed to help developers, designers, and enthusiasts find the perfect software alternatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2025, software is fragmented. Finding a specific tool often means searching through Reddit threads, GitHub repositories, and SEO-spam blogs. We built ToolStock to centralize this data.
